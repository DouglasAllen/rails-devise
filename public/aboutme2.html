          Greetings Web Programmers!
        </dt>		  
        <dd>
          <p>This was an assignment for RubyLearning Web Programming. It's a static page running on github pages.</p>

          <p>I'm running an old Compaq with <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a> that was purchased at Radio Shack in 2002.<br/>
			      I had a Dell that I got from my sister untill it got zapped by lightning.</p>
          <p>Right now Kali is a Debian version called Wheezy and is an update of <br/>
			     <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/">Backtrack</a>.</p>
          <p>In my face book timeline you can see more about things I've done in the past. <br/>
                                   I used to love to build things in electronics.<br/>
                                   I've done assembly and repair work for many products.</p>
          <p>I have an extra class amateur radio license and my call sign is KB9AGT.<br/>
                                   I started with classes from my local radio club.<br/>
                                  Try to find one near you and I'm sure they could help you. Watch your newspapers. <br/>
                                  Get that license and you can do things like http://www.echolink.org/<br/>
                                  You don't need to build or buy a whole bunch of antennas and rigs.<br/>
                                  You can use your computer and an internet connection. The reason that you need a license to use Echolink <br/>
                                  is because some HAMs have it hooked up to real amateur radio transmitters and so you would actually be using the airwaves.</p>
          <p>I have an Associate of Applied Science degree in Electricity and Electronics Technology from Kishwaukee College, IL.<br/>
                                  I also had military training in radio repair before that. It was in the 2800 communications field.</p>			
        
          <p>These days I'm busy learning what I can about Ruby by reading books and searching the web.</p>
          <p>I tend to post a lot of stuff about Ruby and projects on my github account.</p>
